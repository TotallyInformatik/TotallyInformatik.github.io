            <p>
              Hello everybody!
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I will share with you guys what I've been up to in the last few days.
            </p>
            <p>
              So first of all, I worked on this website! I updated it once to make it look a little better, and now I've updated it the second time. Now the Website has a darkmode feature!
              This is done via a javascript file. That file basically adds the class "dark-mode" to all elements on this site. If you then add seperate styles for darkmode elements and non-darkmode elements
              in css, it will work just fine! If you still don't understand what I mean, just hit F12.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sadly, I still wasn't able to put in all of the programs I have made. If you look on the "My Projects" Page, most scripts are still not available.
              I will work on that though, before moving on to the next Project!
            </p>
            <p>
              Second of all, I started working on another program. This is a pretty simple program, and for me personally, it will be extraordinarily useful. I won't be revealing what it does yet though! So stay tuned!
            </p>
            <p>
              Third of all, I dropped the Sims project. It was not fun at all, and I really wantet to do something else with Java, and that would be: 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Minecraft Mods!</strong></p>
            <p>
              To be honest, I have wanted to make mods in Minecraft for a long time now. But I have never really done it for some reason.
              Sadly, the learning process in this case was weirdly frustrating. I had to restart multiple times because something just didn't work and I didn't know why.
              But I will of course not be giving up anytime soon. I have wanted to do this for a long time now, so I will be the stubborn person I am and keep on trying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I have done some other things too! I made my own Minecraft server to play on with friends and also a discord server (which is still in developemnt though).
              What does both have to do with programming? Well, once the Discord server is set up, I will use it as a place to code with my friends and work on projects together.
              In addition to that, I will be trying to code all bots of that Discord server myself! The Minecraft server is just a way for me to play and test mods I will be making in the future with my friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have a lot of plans for the future! I will be exploring the world of AI-Development and Computer Science. I want to understand Machine Learning and Computers better than before.
              That way, I might be able to make my own AI, and I will also know how a PC works!
            </p>

            <h2>13th Apr 2020</h2>
            <p>
              HEEEYYYYY I am BACK.
            </p>
            <p>
              So Today I finished a new version of the moodle calendar (1.1) and I am making it public. You can find it <a href="./../My Projects/ProjectSites/Moodle-Calendar/MoodleCalendar.html">here</a> or at the "My Projects" site and you guys can now install this program. The program is German though, so if anybody really wants
              an english version, you can contact me <a href="./../About/About.html">here</a> and in adition to that, the moodle Website that is specified is not costumizable, but I will allow for url costumization the next version which will likely be released tomorrow or the day after. Despite that, you can still use the program to plan your day, because you can log in without moodle Account details in version 1.1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, if you're curious on how this program works or what the new version does, just head over to the My Projects site.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for my plans concerning programming, I will be taking a break from Python and will start programming in Java. I will make a little game and hopefully get to modding Minecraft. Something I've been wanting to do for some time now.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have also ordered two books. One that deals with general computer science and one that deals with AI. So now I will have something to read again! Once these books arrive, I will post something here and on my social media accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh did I mention social media? Yes I did! You can track my activity and other things there from now on too, so head to the footer to get to those accounts!
            </p>
            <p>
              That's it for now! Next week I will also be putting other projects such as the TicTacToe AI I made some time ago onto this website, so stay tuned.
            </p>

              <h2 >5th Apr 2020</h2>
              <p>
                Hey everybody! I am back! I took a while off because I had lots of things to do in school. But from now on I will try to post as much as possible on this website!
                During corona time I have made a lot of progress in programming (in my opinion), so let me share with you one of the programes I have written.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now that the coronavirus exists, my school also had to shut down. We are currently receiving our education online via a platform called Moodle. You might know that website. 
                Anyways, learning online has not been a good experience for me. We only receive tasks by our teachers and we have to do them and submit the tasks. Since we are doing our tasks from home, we can do them whenever we want to, so that means
                I have to plan my day. Even though I am not bad at organizing my day (maybe even one of the best in my grade), I just couldn't get myself to plan anything or do any of the tasks. 
                I found that the main problem was that, when doing the excercises, I was constantly thinking about programming or doing something with the computer. Anything, except for doing the excercises I was suppossed to do.
                Normaly, I am very disciplined, I don't want to play games, I do the things that I have to do even if i don't want to do it, but now, it is as if I had lost all motivation. I just wanted to work on programming projects, problems etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                If that wasn't enough, the Moodle website or the way my teachers have been using this website to educate us has not helped me plan my day at all. The tasks are not organized, tasks you have completed still remain 
                and often you forget what you've done and what you haven't, because teachers will sometimes add more excercises in the middle of the week! In order to help myself, I decided to program an executable
                which reads off of the Moodle website and only shows me the tasks I haven't done. This is done with a calendar system that displays every day that has a task due, red. That way, I can plan days more efficiently.
                When you click on those days, you see a list of excercises that are due and the exact times they are due! You can click a button that redirects you to a site that gives a more indepth description of that exercise and where you
                can submit your tasks!
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also implemented a feature where you can add your own tasks. Now I can plan my day on my computer and see all of the tasks that are actually relevant in one program!
              </p>
              <p>
                Now you might say: "but Rui! There is a calendar on Moodle already that displays all of the tasks! Your work is useless!" But listen. That calendar has it's own flaws too, at least in my own opinion!
                The calendar for example doesn't show what day it is! Since I am that kind of person who sometimes forgets what day it is and really doesn't care about it either. Knowing what day it is is essential for a
                calendar that should make organization easier, because if the current date were highlighted on that calendar, I would have a much better idea of what tasks are the most urgent!
              </p>
              <p>
                Another problem is that the tasks that Í have already submitted are still shown!!! That way I do not know whether or not a day is highlighted because there are tasks teachers have added that I actually have to do, or 
                if that day is only highlighted because Moodle doesn't automatically delete tasks that you have done!
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of whether or not this application is useful for everybody (and if it is for many, I will probably upload it onto this website to allow you to download it), I had a lot of fun programming it and for me it is actually quite useful! I learned a lot of things (tkinter, beautifulsoup4, datetime, requests, etc.) and
                I found out a lot of stuff I can work on in my next project! (I have to focus on making a program that has an easily modifiable structure and that has readable code)
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyways, that is it for now! If you still don't understand the program you can head over to my Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrY2gIg_7vrlKUp9Cim6LBA">TotallyInformatik</a> where I demonstrate how it works.
                I have also programed an algorithm that finds the path through a maze and solved a few "hard" programming problems (according to a coding problem subscription). But since this blog post is already quite long and I should really go to bed, I will be talking about it in another blog post!
                There are also going to be videos on my Youtube channel concerning these programes!

                So, when I created this website, I wanted to post a blog entry every week. Not only did I realize that that wouldn't be possible, 
                because school is a thing I didn't even know how to write a proper blog. And since I am too lazy to search up how to write a blog correctly, 
                you guys would just have to accept this awkward introduction.
              </p>
              <p >
                Hi, my name is Rui, as you might have read in the "About" section I am 14 years old and I like to code. 
                My main goal currently is to create an executable app using Python and the Tkinter module as well as the os module. Sadly, I haven't made much progress yet. School is 
                really taking up most of my time and I have to prepare for an English Contest tomorrow too. But hopefully I will find Time to continue learning Tkitner.
              </p>
              <p >
                So for now, I will tell you guys about the things we are learning in our programming class right now.
                At school, we are currently using the MIT app inventor to develop apps, whose interface is very similar to Scratch. The next programming exam will be replaced
                with a project. We'll have to create an app and that app will be graded.
                I decided to create a snake game.
              </p>
              <p >

                Still, I would definitely prefer app development using Python or another programming language instead of the MIT app inventor, yet the only reason is because I like to type.
                If anybody knows why you would want to use the MIT app inventor instead of Python and vice versa, please, send me an email using the contact form. 
              </p>
              <p >
                So that's all for now!
                By the way, I have a YouTube channel -> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrY2gIg_7vrlKUp9Cim6LBA">TotallyInformatik</a> where I post code related content which is in a funny format, so if this blog is getting too boring for you, just check out my channel,
                you will be able to track my progress there too.
